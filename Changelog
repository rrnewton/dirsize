release-1-1:
	I'm confused... this one works.  It even works on my ffh
directory if I do "ds".  But when I do "ds *" on my ffh dir it gets a
bus error on "home"!!  Hmm... even doing "ds home" or "ds"/"ds ."
within home works...  Very odd.

release-1-0: This works but it uses only 32 bit integers and overflows easily...
