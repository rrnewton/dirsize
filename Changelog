release-1-1:
	I'm confused... this one works.  It even works on my ffh
directory if I do "ds".  But when I do "ds *" on my ffh dir it gets a
bus error on "home"!!  Hmm... even doing "ds home" or "ds"/"ds ."
within home works...  Very odd.
  	Ack, the mystery increases when doing "ds home" I got the
correct numbers for filecounts, dircounts, linkcounts, (and dir and
link sizes), but I got 3 quadrillion for the summed plain file size.
Whereas "ds ." within home gets the correct amount!  What sort of bug
is this..?  "ds /ffh/ryan/home" segfaults or gets a buserror... sigh,
the problem must be keeping too much in the tree at once... but I
thought my method of keeping a stack of dirs that need to be summed
prevented this?

release-1-0: This works but it uses only 32 bit integers and overflows easily...
